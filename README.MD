# world.execute(me);

The Godot C# implementation of "Mili - world.execute(me);" that plays like the source MV in three different styles.

## Features

This project provides three distinct styles of the "world.execute(me);" experience:

1. **Console Style** - A text-based simulation that mimics a console environment
2. **C# Style** - A C# code-inspired presentation with programming syntax elements  
3. **Java Style** - The original style from the MV, implemented with Java code-inspired presentation

## About

This is a Godot C# implementation that plays the "Mili - world.execute(me);" song with visual effects and text animations similar to the [source MV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESx_hy1n7HA). The project recreates the poetic and philosophical atmosphere of the original music video through interactive text simulation in the Godot game engine.

## Requirements

- Godot 4.x with .NET support
- .NET 8.0 or higher

## Usage

Simply run the project in Godot to experience the full "world.execute(me);" simulation. The implementation automatically cycles through the different presentation styles to provide a complete experience similar to the original music video.

## Audio

> **Note**: This project does not distribute the original audio files due to copyright restrictions. To enjoy the complete experience with audio:
> 
> 1. Obtain the "world.execute(me);" audio file legally as a WAV file
> 2. Place the audio file in the `audio/` folder
> 3. Rename the file to `world.execute(me);.wav`

## Fonts

This project uses the JetBrains Mono font family ([JetBrainsMono[wght].ttf](JetBrainsMono[wght].ttf)) for rendering text with beautiful monospace typography that fits the coding theme of the simulation.

## Components

The project includes a custom [MouseAvoidText](MouseAvoidText.cs) control that creates an interactive text effect where characters avoid the mouse cursor, providing a unique user interface experience in the main menu.
